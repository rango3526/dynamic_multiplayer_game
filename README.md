# VR Grapple Hook Racer
Tentative thoughts:
- Grapple hook racing through city with tall buildings in VR
- Like mario kart combat race but in the air
- Maybe one person controlling the environment (traps, etc) (maybe is a huge giant destroying things)
- Maybe plague/covid? Somehow?
- Ghosts (show best path?/tutorial) (or maybe dead players haunting??)
- Maybe earn/steal items from players? Maybe start out with items? Maybe do trick shots or shortcuts for items?
- Power-up by following exactly a trail (consuming the gas)
- Centripetal force around corners
- Maybe retro/futuristic/RGB artistic theme
- Maybe distopia city map (think cyberpunk)
